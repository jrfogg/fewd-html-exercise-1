    <h1>Of Patterns and Power: Web Standards Then and Now</h1>
    <br>
    <div class ="first paragraph">
    <p>IN <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">
      “CONTENT Display Patterns”</a> (which all front-end folk should read),
      Dan Mall points to a truth not unlike the one
      <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/">
      Ethan Marcotte shared last month</a> on 24 ways.It is a truth as old as
      standards-based design:Construct your markup to properly support your content
      (not your design).</p></div>

      <!--Second Paragraph-->
      <div class="second paragraph">
      <p>Modular/<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">
        atomic design</a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces
        its wisdom. <a href = "https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">
        Flexbox</a> and <a href ="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">
        grid layout</a> don’t change this truth, they just make it easier
        to do it better. <a href="https://html5forwebdesigners.com/design/index.html">
        HTML5</a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reminds us that the separation of structure from style came
        into existence for a reason. A reason that hasn’t changed.
        A reason that cannot change, because it is the core truth of the web,
        and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.</p></div>

      <!--Third Paragraph-->
      <div class="third paragraph">
      <p>Separating structure from style and behavior was the web standards
        movement’s prime revelation, and each generation of web designers discovers it anew.
        This separation is what makes our content as backward-compatible as it is
        forward-compatible (or <a href ="http://futurefriendlyweb.com/">
        “future-friendly,”</a> if you prefer). It’s the key to re-use. The key to accessibility.
        The key to the new kinds of CMS systems we’re just beginning to dream up.
        It’s what makes our content as accessible to an ancient device
        as it will be to an unimagined future one.</p></div>


      <!--Fourth Paragraph-->
      <div class="fourth paragraph">
      <p>Every time a leader in our field discovers, as if for the first time,
         the genius of this separation between style, presentation, and behavior,
         she is validating the brilliance of web forbears
         like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">
         Tim Berners-Lee, Håkon Wium Lie, and Bert Bos.</a></p></div>


      <!--Fifth Paragraph-->
      <div class="fifth paragraph">
      <p>Every time a Dan or an Ethan
         (or a <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/">Sara</a> or a <a href ="http://lea.verou.me/">Lea</a>)
         writes a beautiful and insightful article like the two cited above,
         they are telling new web designers, and reminding experienced ones,
         that this separation of powers matters.</p></div>

      <!--Short Sentence1-->
      <div class="short sentence1">
      <p>And they are plunging a stake into the increasingly slippery ground
         beneath us.</p></div>
