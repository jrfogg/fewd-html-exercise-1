    <h1>Of Patterns and Power: Web Standards Then and Now</h1>
    <br>
    <div class ="first paragraph">
    <p>IN <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">
      “CONTENT Display Patterns”</a> (which all front-end folk should read),
      Dan Mall points to a truth not unlike the one
      <a href="https://24ways.org/2015/putting-my-patterns-through-their-paces/">
      Ethan Marcotte shared last month</a> on 24 ways.It is a truth as old as
      standards-based design:Construct your markup to properly support your content
      (not your design).</p></div>

      <!--Second Paragraph-->
      <div class="second paragraph">
      <p>Modular/<a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">
        atomic design</a> doesn’t change this truth, it just reinforces
        its wisdom. <a href = "https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">
        Flexbox</a> and grid layout don’t change this truth, they just
        make it easier to do it better. HTML5 doesn’t change this truth,
        it just reminds us that the separation of structure from style came
        into existence for a reason. A reason that hasn’t changed.
        A reason that cannot change, because it is the core truth of the web,
        and is inextricably bound up with the promise of this medium.</p></div>
